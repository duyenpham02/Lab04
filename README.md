1.When calling the function twice in a row with the same argument, instead of having 10 random numbers, the function will be implemented twice and since we're using the same vector, it will add all of the random numbers of the 2 vectors into 1 vector and that vector will have a total of 20 random numbers.

2.You can perform on any data type.
